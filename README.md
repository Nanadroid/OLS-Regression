# OLS-Regression

This project was developed as part of the Machine Learning for Asset Pricing class at the Claremont Graduate University for a degree in MS Financial Engineering.
The work is a cross sectional regression by OLS.
The Fama-French factors Mkt_rf, SMB, HML and RF.

"In [asset pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_pricing) and [portfolio management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management) the Fama–French three-factor model is a [statistical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model) designed in 1992 by [Eugene Fama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Fama) and [Kenneth French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_French) to describe stock returns. Fama and French were colleagues at the [University of Chicago Booth School of Business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago_Booth_School_of_Business), where Fama still works. In 2013, Fama shared the [Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Memorial_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences) for his empirical analysis of asset prices.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fama%E2%80%93French_three-factor_model#cite_note-1) The three factors are:

Market excess return,
[Outperformance of small versus big companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Size_premium), and
Outperformance of high [book/market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book-to-market_ratio) versus low book/market companies"

## Overview
 **Model**


$$\\ y_t = \left(X^\mathbf{**|**}_t{\beta} \right)+u_t$$


a) find the estimator b of the factor loadings β in the factor model

b) find **R**$$^2$$

c) find the $$t$$- statistic for every factor loading

## Language Used
      Python (Python 3.11.9)
      

## Summary of Results
